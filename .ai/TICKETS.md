## 🤖 Usage Guide

1. Check this file before starting work; do not assume you can self-assign tasks.
2. Create tickets using incremental IDs (e.g., TICKET-001) when stakeholders ask
   for new features or fixes. Capture acceptance criteria alongside manual test
   steps when possible.
3. Link to dated specs in `/.ai/features/` for multi-step workflows.
4. Move completed tickets to the **Done** section with the actual completion
   date and a short summary of the delivered change.
